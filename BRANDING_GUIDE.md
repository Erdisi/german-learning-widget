# ðŸŽ¨ German Learning Widget - Branding Guide

## ðŸ“‹ OVERVIEW

This document outlines the comprehensive branding system for the German Learning Widget, implementing the **60-30-10 color rule** for professional, harmonious, and accessible design.

## ðŸŽ¯ THE 60-30-10 COLOR RULE

Based on professional color theory, our implementation follows:

- **60% Dominant Color**: Main backgrounds, large surfaces
- **30% Secondary Color**: Text, navigation, headers, supporting UI elements  
- **10% Accent Color**: Buttons, highlights, call-to-actions, interactive elements

### Why This Rule Works
- **Visual Balance**: Prevents any single color from overwhelming the design
- **Emphasizes Key Elements**: Accent color (10%) naturally draws attention
- **Simplicity**: Three-color limit creates clean, professional appearance
- **Consistency**: Standardized proportions across all app components
